# Lord Of The Rings Collectibles <a name="top"></a>

This is an e-commerce website for golf products that I create for **Milestone Project 4 (Full Stack Frameworks with Django)** in [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), Ireland. The use of the website is for educational purposes only, however, all the functionalities work as if it is an actual e-commerce website. It is a mobile responsive website and the link to the website is available [HERE](https://lotr-collectibles.herokuapp.com/).

## USER STORIES

There are two types of users for the website. One is shoppers whose primary goal is to view the products and purchase them online. The other one is the shop owner whose primary goal is to sell their products and run a business. I am a full-stack web developer and create an e-commerce website to meet the primary goals of the users and their stories.
