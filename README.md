# Lord Of The Rings Collectibles <a name="top"></a>

This is an e-commerce website for collectibles products that I create for **Milestone Project 4 (Full Stack Frameworks with Django)** in [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), Ireland. The use of the website is for educational purposes only, however, all the functionalities work as if it is an actual e-commerce website. It is a mobile responsive website and the link to the website is available [HERE](https://lotr-collectibles.herokuapp.com/).

## USER STORIES

There are two types of users for the website. One is shoppers whose primary goal is to view the products and purchase them online. The other one is the shop owner whose primary goal is to sell their products and run a business. I am a full-stack web developer and create an e-commerce website to meet the primary goals of the users and their stories.

## UX 5 PLANES

### Strategy Plane

To achieve the user's primary goals and stories outlined in the User Stories section, all the functions and features on the tables below are minimum requirements and they are implemented in the website. (On a scale of 1 [least] - 5 [most])

Below are the additional functions and features that can improve the website, however, these are not mandatory to achieve the current user goals and stories. Some are not implemented due to a lack of my current skills & knowledge and some are due to a lack of time.

| Opportunity                                     | Importance | Viability / Feasibility |

| Payment in different currencies                 |     2      |            1            |

### Scope Plane

Based on the requirements of achieving user's and owner's goals and stories, below is the list of required pages with the features and functions. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions are implemented on the website as it is required for admin user's product management.

- Simple design Home page that the purpose of the website is obvious to anybody and even first-time users know how to navigate the website. Clearly displayed group of categories (e.g. Action Figures | Statues | Others) that have categories in it (e.g. Others --> Jewelry | Prop Replica | Games)
- Product pages by the group of categories where users can view all the products belong to the group. Users are navigated to categories in this group from this page
- Product pages by category where users can view all the products belong to the category
- Product details page where uses can see all the product details. Users can also select options (e.g. Size) and put the product in the cart
- Shopping Cart page where users can see all the selected products before purchase. Users can change the quantity of the product or remove it
- Checkout page where users can provide shipping details and credit card details
- Checkout success page where users get confirmation of purchase
- Register page where users can create an account to keep the shipping address saved and to view order histories
- Login page where users can log in to the page
- Profile page where users can see the personal details and order histories
- Logout function that users can safely log out the website and takes users back to the home page
- Product Management pages (admin only) where admin can add, edit, and delete products
- 404 & 500 pages where users are taken back to home page safely when they visit a page does not exist or an invalid page
<br>

### Structure Plane

‚Äî **Front-end** ‚Äî

The website consists of below core `HTML` pages and has some `CSS` and `JavaScript` 

- **Home** (`index.html`)<br>
The main page of the website. There is a logo, search function, navigation to *Group of Categories & Categories*, *Register* & *Login* and *Shopping Cart* pages, a hero image with Shop Now button. There are icons of popular brands that users can click and view the products of the brand. There is a section of "Why LoTR Collectibles?" which provides a few reasons for buying products with the shop. There is a footer with a form to subscribe to newsletter and some social icons. **The same header and footer are used across all html files*

- **Products** (`products.html`, `products/<category_name>.html`)<br>
The pages where users can see products by a group of categories & category and have an access to the product details page.

- **Product Details** (`product/<product_id>.html`)<br>
The pages where users can see product details, with an option to select criteria (e.g. size) and add it in the shopping cart.

- **Shopping Cart** (`cart.html`)<br>
The page where users can view all the selected products and details. Users can adjust the quantity and there is an option to remove products. There is a button link to a checkout page for the final step of shopping. 

- **Checkout** (`checkout.html`)<br>
The page where users can process the purchase. Strip, which is a secured platform for credit card payment, is used on the website for processing payments.  

- **Checkout Success** (`checkout_success.html`)<br>
The confirmation page where users are lead to when the payment process is completed. Users can see the order number, shipping address, product details. This page is accessible for registered users from Profile.

- **Register** (`signup.html`)<br>
The page where users can create an account to save their details for next shopping and keep their purchase histories. A form with a built-in function is created with Django Allauth package.

- **Login** (`login.html`)<br>
The page where users can log in to the website and access to the Profile page to see the personal details and purchase histories. A form with a built-in function is created with Django Allauth package.

- **Profile** (`profile.html`)<br>
The page where users can see personal details and purchase histories.

- **Add Products** (`add_products.html`)<br>
The page where only *Admin* has access and add a new product on the website.

- **Edit Products** (`edit_products.html`)<br>
The page where only *Admin* has access and edit products.

- **Page 404 & 500** (`404.html`, `500.html`)<br>
The error pages that appear when the page is not found or invalid and where users are led to the Home page safely.

- **Base Templates** (`base.html` and `base.css`)<br>
The template documents that have core components of html and css and are used among other html files.

- **Admin** (`/admin`)<br>
The admin panel, which can be created with Django project, where Admin can take control of products and other data.

- **CSS** & **JavaScript** (`.css` & `.js`)<br>
CSS and JavaScript files of those HTML files are created within the same app folder.

<br>

‚Äî **Back-end** ‚Äî<br>

Users have options to purchase products as guest users or account holder users. Guest users cannot save personal details for their next shopping as personal details such as name, email address, shipping address etc belong to their order in the database. Account holder users who create an account with their <ins>email address</ins> and <ins>username</ins>, user name (user profile) is linked with their order so that personal details can be retrieved. Each product belongs to a category, a brand and these are identified by id. Each order has a unique order number which is generated when the order is processed and orders have shopper's and product details.<br>
SQLite, which is Django built-in database is used for development mode and Heroku Postgre is used for production mode. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is used to hold all static files and folders for the website for production mode.

### Skeleton Plane

The website is created as a desktop-first because it is easy to picture the whole image of the website, however, it is a fully mobile responsive website as well so shoppers using a mobile phone have no difficulties looking for products and purchase them. Below are the wireframes of the core pages of the website.<br>

### Surface Plane

‚Äî **Colours** ‚Äî

This is an e-commerce website that has a lot of products with images containing different colours, **White** (#FFFFFF) is used as the main background colour to keep the entire image of the website settled. The shop colour is **Hunter Green** (#09572A) and this is used for some icons and fonts. **Back Chocolate** (#231703) is used as the main font colour, **Maximum Yellow Red** (#E7BA55) is used for buttons and alerts to stand them out. **Middle Green Yellow** (#9AB250) is used for other things that need user's attention. These are the base colours and similar colours are used on the different parts and sections on the website.

> **Note:**<br>
> **Hunter Green** (#09572A) is not used for any fonts or icons but used for the colour of toast success

‚Äî **Typography** ‚Äî

**Abril Fatface** is used for all the texts because good readability is an important factor for e-commerce websites from the user's point of view. Also resemble a book title, which is the case for better website UX. Uses as second font **Roboto**, which is one very popular google fonts.

## WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN
This is a full-stack website that contains both front-end & back-end, so many Django apps, features and functions, therefore a good website development plan is required to maximise the efficiency of the development. GitHub project planner, which has a Kanban planner, is used for this project. Below is the summary of core tasks* for the website and more detailed tasks are listed on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/projects/1). This gives not only very clear planning but also making sure nothing is missed during the process.<br>
**Follow the same process as Code Institute Mini Project, Boutique Ado*

1. Planning The Website with UX5 Planes
1. Project Set-Up (Installing Django, Setting up Project, Testing connection, Creating Django superuser)
1. Authentication & Authorisation (Installing Allauth, Testing)
1. The Base Template (Creating base template)
1. The Home Page (Navigation bar, Header and Footer)
1. Products Set-Up (Creating Products app, Installing data, Filtering & Searching)
1. The Shopping Cart (Adding and adjusting products)
1. Toasts (Real-time notification)
1. Checkout with Stripe (Function, Form, Testing Stripe)
1. Profile (Displaying personal details and order history)
1. Product Admin (CRUD function for products)
1. Deployment (AWS, Heroku)
1. Emails (Setting up email functionality)
1. Code Refactoring (Checking code, Reviewing the design and updating)
1. Testing (Testing for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, User Stories, Functions and Features)
1. Final Check Before Submission

> **Note:**<br>
> **CSS**: In previous projects, get confused by Bootstrap CSS classes and my own CSS classes so for this project, two dashes (a kind of BEM methodology) is used on all CSS classes 

<div align="right"><a href="#top">üîù</a></div>

## FEATURES

### Existing Features

- Create with **HTML5**, **CSS3** (with Material Design for Bootstrap), **JavaScript**, **Python** (Django Framework), **Stripe**, **AWS** and **Heroku**
- It consists of 1 product with 5 apps in Django
- It consists of 1 base html template and 12 main html files. (Excluding sub html files and some allauth html files)
- Modal for "Delivery Cost" information
- Toast for user's action
- All the features planned on [Strategy Plane](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/tree/main/readme/features/strategy-plane.png) and [Scope Plane](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/tree/main/readme/features/scope-plane.png)

### Features Left To Implement

- **Displaying number of product images per product:** This would probably be possible to implement by using the same principle as Carousel, however, cannot confirm it for sure and do not have time to work on this, decide to leave it out in this project

- **Enlarging image when hovering:** Find a few ways of enlarging (zooming) images on hover, however, not sure if these are the same as enlarging images of products that are used in e-commerce websites. Currently, no time to look at the details so decide to leave it out in this project

- **Refinements options:** This might be implemented by different combinations of filter, however, currently have no skill to achieve this so decide to leave it out in this project

- **More detailed categories and advertisement:** This is to have more detailed categories (e.g. There are only 11 categories but actual e-commerce website, there should be more categories available = more products) and more detailed advertisement such as having different colours, guidance for size etc. Currently have no time to work on this, decide to leave it out in this project

- **Creating an account with social media:** Look at a tutorial and not sure if this can be implemented easily. All the testing is done and confirmed all the functions are working, and afraid of breaking something unintentionally by linking social account login, decide to leave this for this project but this is something would like to try with my own project as a challenge

- **Product comparison:** This seems to be a very advanced feature and do not even know how to look up for this with my current skill and knowledge so decide to leave it out in this project

- **Payment in different currencies:** This might be possible with Stripe rather than Django, but not sure how to achieve this. As this is not an important feature with the current project and do not have time to look at it, decide to leave it out in this project

## PROJECT BARRIERS & SOLUTIONS

 **Heroku App Deployment** ‚Äî

 On the deployment part, I succeed when building up the app but the app crashes, and in the logs --tail it shows an error to the GET method. What was happening was that heroku couldn't load the static files.
 <br>
 I had to roll back a few commits and start again the deployment. I missed one step of adding SECRET KEY, and also did a typo in settings.py. In the end that worked out for me.

  **Databases not connecting with each other** ‚Äî

  Once I've deployed I continued adding more products, but I notice that in the deployed website (heroku) they weren't been added.
  So I tried to check if there was something wrong in the setting, with the paths and base directory, I tried to see if I had more than one DB sqlite, and it was only one, everything was fine... I also tried to add a new product to see if the rows in the postgres DB would go up, but they haven't changed at all.
  I will check with the tutors to see if they can help me out.

## VERSION CONTROL

## DEPLOYMENT

The website of this project requires back-end technologies such as server, application, and database so the website is deployed in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), which is a cloud platform with a service supporting several programming languages, because GitHub can only host a static website. Heroku Postgres is used for the database. [AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/), which is also a cloud-based platform, is used to store static files and images as Heroku has *no files system to store new files* [*Reference from Code Institue Slack](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/reference-aws.png).


Below are the processes of deploying the website to Heroku and setting up static files & images in AWS.

‚Äî **HEROKU** ‚Äî

1. Create an app in Heroku. Click *New*, put App name and select region<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/create-app1.png)<br><br>

1. Add Heroku Postgres for the database<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/heroku-postgres.png)

1. Install `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2-binary` to use Heroku Postgres, and run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` command to add them on requirments.txt<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/requirements-txt.png)

1. Update `settings.py` of the product (lotr_collectibles). Import `dj_database_url`, comment out sqlite databases and add dj databases variable temporary while the database is transferred to Heroku Postgres<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/databases.png)

1. Run `python3 manage.py showmigrations` command to see the status of migrations (Currently not migrated). Run `python3 manage.py migrate` command to migrate<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/migrate.png)

1. Import all products data. Run `python3 manage.py loaddata` command to load the **categories** first, **brands** next and **products** the last. The order of loading is important as all the products are associated with categories and brands

1. Create a super user with `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` command for product admin

1. Install `gunicorn` which acts as the webserver, and freeze it into requirments file with `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` command<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/requirements-txt2.png)

1. Create a **Procfile** which specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/procfile.png)

1. Temporary disable collectstatic by setting `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1` and host name of Heroku to allowed hosts in `settings.py`

1. Initialise Heroku in git with `heroku git:remote -a lort-collectibles` and put git into Heroku with `git push heroku main`

1. Set up automatic deployment when git is pushed to GitHub. Go to Deployment on Heroku, search the GitHub repository, connect and click Enable Automatic Deploys<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/auto-deployment.png)<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/auto-deployment2.png)<br><br>

1. Generate a new secret key, set it up in Heroku and update `settings.py`. Change the setting of Debug mode that only True in Development mode<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/secret-key.png)<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/secret-key2.png)

1. Check Activity Feed to see Build in Progress to confirm automatic deployment is working

‚Äî **AWS** ‚Äî

1. Open S3 and create a new bucket, which stores the files, by completing the name and region<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/create-bucket.png)

1. Set up basic settings. Enable static website hosting so that give a new endpoint for accessing from the internet. Put `index.html` and `error.html` as default values<br><br>

1. Set up CORS configuration which is the access between Heroku and this S3 Bucket<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/cors.png)

1. Set up Bucket Policy. Generate a policy with AWS policy generator. Add /* at the end of Resource to allow access to all recources in the bucket<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/bucket-policy.png)

1. Create a user to access to the bucket. Go to IAM (Identity and Access Management) and create a group for user to live in. Then, create a policy by importing pre-built policy<br><br>

1. Attach the policy to the group<br><br>

![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/attach-policy2.png)

1. Create a user and add it to the group. When the user is added to the group, it creates csv file containing Access Key ID and Secret access key which are used to authenticate them from Django app. *It is very important to download the file and save it as you cannot download it again<br><br>

‚Äî **Connecting to DJANGO** ‚Äî

1. Install two new packages, `pip3 install boto3`, `pip3 install django-storages`, and run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` command to add them on requirements.txt<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/requirements-txt3.png)

1. Update `settings.py` to tell Django which bucket it should be communicating with *It is very important to keep AWS access keys secrets as these can be used to store or move data in the bucket and you will be charged by Amazon for it<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/django-aws-settings.png)

1. Add these secret keys on Heroku and set USE_AWS = True<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/heroku-config-vars.png)

1. Create `custome_storages.py` to tell Django to use S3 to store static files and upload images when it is in production<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/custom-storages.png)

1. Add `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell Django where the static files come from in production and add some settings for Static and Media files on `settings.py`<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/settings-static.png)

1. Add all the update in git, commit it and push it to GitHub. Heroku runs `python3 manage.py` to collectstatic during the process which also searches through all the apps and project folders looking for static files. Then, it uses S3 domain settings in conjunction with the custom storage classes that tells the location at the URL where the things should be saved when it is in production. This can be confirmed in S3 bucket<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/static-folders-s3.png)

1. Add Cache control on `settings.py` as static files do not change often and to improve the performance for users<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/cache-control.png)

1. Upload product images via S3. Create a folder, and upload images<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/create-folder.png)<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/upload.png)

1. Verify superuser's email address on Heroku Postgres. Login admin and check the VERIFIED and PRIMARY boxes<br><br>

![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/verify4.png)

1. Add Stripe keys to Heroku Config Vars and create a new webhook endpoint<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/lotr-collectibles/blob/main/readme/deployment/stripe-config-vars.png)<br><br>
