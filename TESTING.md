### Html

— **Code Validation** —

After all HTML files have been coded, a code validation test is run using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), which is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium that allows validating HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed markup, as well as any warnings and errors.

— **Form Validation** —

On the website Lord Of The Rings Collectibles, there are certain forms to fill out. Some are validated on the front end (for example, the @ mark for email input), while others are validated on the back end (e.g. existing user name). A manual test is run to ensure that the validations and form functions are functioning appropriately.
